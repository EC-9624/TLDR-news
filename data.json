    "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60295177?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA",
    "published": "Tue, 07 Feb 2023 10:40:05 GMT",
    "content": "Critics want the windfall tax on oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea to be extended after BP and Shell reported record profits for 2022.The Energy Profits Levy was introduced in May 2022.A windfall tax is an extra levy imposed by a government on a company.It targets firms which benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall.Energy firm profits have soared, initially because of rising demand after Covid restrictions were lifted, and then because because Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised energy prices.Shell reported profits of $39.9bn (\u00a332.2bn) in 2022, the highest in its 115-year history.BP made profits of $27.7bn (\u00a323bn) in the same year, up from $12.8bn in 2021.Both companies have increased their dividend payments - the money they give directly to shareholders.And they have spent billions buying back their own shares from the market, in order to increase their value.While they have benefited from high oil and gas prices, both firms say they have lost a lot of money as a result of stopping investments in Russian oil firms.BP said that its UK businesses account for less than 10% of its global profits while Shell makes about 5% of its revenue in the UK.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak introduced the 25% Energy Profits Levy when he was chancellor.In the 2022 Autumn Statement, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced it would increase to 35% from January 2023, and run until March 2028. It was previously due to finish at the end of 2025. The levy applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas, but not from other activities - such as refining oil and selling petrol and diesel on forecourts.Labour criticised the scheme because it also lets firms claim tax savings worth 91p of every \u00a31 invested in fossil fuel extraction in the UK. That allowance will continue. Mr Hunt said the tax would raise \u00a340bn over six years.The government also introduced a temporary 45% levy on what it calls extraordinary returns from low-carbon electricity generators in the UK.Larger operators started paying the Electricity Generator Levy on 1 January. The government hopes it will raise about \u00a314bn over six years.Shell initially said it did not expect to pay any windfall tax for 2022, as its North Sea investments meant was not considered to have made any UK profits.But on 2 February it announced that it would pay $134m (\u00a3108m) for 2022, and expected to pay more than $500m (\u00a3400m) for 2023.BP said it would pay $700m (\u00a3583m) in windfall tax for 2022.Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea are taxed differently to other firms.Taxes on their profits are higher - they pay 30% corporation tax on their profits and a supplementary 10% rate on top of that. Other firms currently pay corporation tax at 19%.But oil and gas firms have been able to reduce the amount of tax they pay by factoring in losses or spending on things like decommissioning North Sea oil platforms.In recent years, such methods have meant that BP and Shell have paid almost no tax in the UK. BP and Shell both received more money back from the UK government than they paid every year from 2015 to 2020 (except 2017, when Shell paid more than it received). Shell also paid a negative amount of tax in 2021, taking its 2015 to 2021 total to -\u00a3685m of tax in the UK.BP paid more money in tax than it received back in 2021, taking its total between 2015 and 2021 to -\u00a3107m. In March 2022, Shell said that it planned to spend between \u00a320bn and \u00a325bn on UK energy over the next 10 years.But in November, UK boss David Bunch told the Confederation of British Industry conference that the company would now have to evaluate each project on a case by case basis, because the windfall tax meant it had less to invest.BP plans to spend a maximum of \u00a318bn on the UK's energy system by the end of 2030. In May 2022, BP chief executive Bernard Looney told the Times newspaper that all of the company's planned UK investments would carry on regardless of any windfall tax. In July, UK boss Louise Kingham told a committee of MPs that the company had initially been concerned about the windfall tax being a multi-year proposal, but that the December 2025 deadline had been helpful. BP has not commented publicly since the 2028 extension announcement.In December 2022, French oil company TotalEnergies said it would cut its planned 2023 investment in the North Sea by a quarter - or \u00a3100 - as a result of the extension to the windfall tax.It wants the government to agree to review the windfall tax if oil and gas prices fall below a certain level before 2028. The European Union (EU) has also imposed a windfall tax on energy companies, with a 33% levy on fossil fuel firms' profits, and another on the revenues made from rising electricity costs.EU ministers estimate that they can raise \u20ac140bn (\u00a3123bn) from the levies.The US energy company ExxonMobil is suing the EU to try to stop them."
